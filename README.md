All about Data Structures and Algorithms

## Why ?

As a Computer engineering student, We need to have a profound knowledge on DSA, to create better solution, to perform faster in more optimom way,... etc. then I decided to make a comprehensive guide or maybe it would be better to say, I decide to disscuss about these following questions about DS and their related algorithms:

***Why should we have used this data structure ?*** \
***What if we use it in another way , more complicated than classic or regular way?*** 

## Duties
1 - Be responsible to my idea\
2 - Respect all learning level\
3 - Use codes as simple as possible , you can write code in all level, but It would be better to use simple syntaxes first.
